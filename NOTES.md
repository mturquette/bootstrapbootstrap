rename project to any of the following:

ghbs
bsbs
bs^2

Create a gh-pages branch that has an "article" for every twbs example. See:
http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples

To do this, create a layout template under _layouts which serves as each type of example. All that is needed is content.
